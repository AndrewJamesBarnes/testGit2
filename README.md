Introduction:
Simple page showing two questions with image select choices. An additional question was added to the graphic to display the progress. The setup used radio button style form fields for simplicity and single submit.

Files:
PSD file shows the support Photoshop images
Layout grabbed from Bootstrap for speed, with some unnecessary code removed.
images file contains all customised artwork
css/questionnaire.css shows all custom styles outside of bootstrap
Some comments in the html file

Layout:
Abstract background with a connectivity type feel with colouring based around the brand. Flexible type image without any focal points that would get lost behind the question blocks. Question types are irrelevant but show interesting  pictorial representation as apposed to plain text.
Colours are consistent with style.

Functions:
Refresh the page or clear cache to reset the page.
Select or touch the buttons
The buttons are large so the work on smaller touch screen devices
The buttons have aria-label comments for accessibility
Fonts are non standard but accessible and clear styles. Although the psychometrics font styles should have been shown here to be on brand , I have decided to show imported font styles which are also clear and accessible.
